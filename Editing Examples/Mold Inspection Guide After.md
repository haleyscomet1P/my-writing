# The Ultimate Guide to Mold Inspections: Everything You Need to Know

Buying a home is always an exciting time, but it’s important to make sure you’re not getting more than you bargained for. A mold inspection can make sure you aren’t opening your home to one of life’s most unsavory roommates. Here’s how to get one done right, including how they work, how much they cost, and what to do if you find mold.

## What is a mold inspection?

### ❗Mold inspections find mold in a home– that’s it.

A mold inspection is a specialized type of home inspection aimed at identifying the presence and scope of mold issues in a house. Mold inspections are distinct from general home inspections, but may be advisable if you’re buying a home with a suspected mold issue. 


## Why would I need a mold inspection? 

### Here’s what to be on the lookout for.

### ⚠️Warning Signs:

-   Unexplained respiratory issues
    
-   General home inspection flags
    
-   Musty smell in home
    
-   Previous leaks or water damage

You may need a mold inspection if your general home inspector suspects a major mold issue, or if you have family members experiencing unexplained respiratory issues. This can help you avoid potential costly repairs after closing. 

The presence of mold in a home isn’t always an immediate cause for panic, but major infestations can be a major issue and expensive to fix, especially when they’re located in inconvenient places. Living in the midst of mold can also cause health issues such as respiratory problems and other allergic reactions for those exposed to it.

  
## What could go wrong?

### ⚠️Mold can and will cause damage to critical home structures such as subflooring, insulation, and drywall.

It’s tempting to ignore mold, especially if no one is experiencing respiratory symptoms and your home seems otherwise unaffected, but mold is usually a symptom of a much bigger problem– excess moisture. Common causes include basement flooding, leaky pipes, rotted siding, failed window seals, and inadequate ventilation. Mold can and will cause damage to critical home structures such as subflooring, insulation, and drywall. Sometimes minor issues can be dealt with by yourself, but if you find a major issue, you’ll usually have to pay for both the mold remediation and the underlying issue causing it.


## What happens during a mold inspection?

### ❗During a mold inspection, the property is checked for signs of mold.

During a mold inspection, the inspector will survey the property, paying particular attention to places that are especially prone to mold. These places might include:

-   Window sills
    
-   Behind large appliances
    
-   In air ducts
    
-   Plumbing fixtures

### ⚠️Sometimes, a mold inspector may need to perform invasive procedures like removing a small piece of drywall to access and examine difficult-to-reach spots. 

The mold inspector will prepare a report following their inspection, which will include the results of any laboratory testing to confirm mold types. From there, your mold inspector should be able to give you an idea of the best way to fix it. 
  

## How much does a mold inspection cost? 

The price of a mold inspection is determined by a number of elements, including the size of your home, the type of specialized mold tests required, the class of mold involved, how easily the inspector can access the affected areas within your home, and other factors unique to your local market. 

### 💲The cost of a mold inspection ranges from $150 to $2,600, with a $649 national average in the United States.
  
There are two main methods mold inspectors use to gather mold specimens for testing: surface sampling and air sampling  .

### Surface Sampling

Surface sampling is the most common method for testing indoor mold, and is also the simplest to perform. This approach costs about $50 per specimen. The inspector will use tape, swabs, or vacuums to collect samples from surfaces in the home, then send them to the lab for analysis.

### Air Sampling

Air sampling is less common than surface sampling and is typically only conducted if a major mold issue is suspected. It’s also more expensive due to its complexity, and typically costs about $150 per test. The inspector compares readings from inside and outside the house to see if there’s a higher concentration of spores indoors. 

  
## My house has mold. Now what? 

### If a mold inspection uncovers a mold issue in a home, you have two options. 

If it’s a minor issue, you can attempt to address it yourself. If it’s a major issue, you may need to hire a professional mold remediation service to handle it.
  

### 🔨DIY (Not to be confused with DI-WHY)

-   Fewer than 10 square feet
    
-   Not caused by contaminated water
    
-   Hard surfaces preferable

If the issue is fewer than 10 square feet and not caused by contaminated water, you can probably safely handle the cleanup yourself. If it’s a hard surface, a simple scrub with water and detergent should be enough. If the surface is absorbent or porous, like a carpet, you’ll need to remove and dispose of it. 


### 🚧Hire a Professional

-   Exceeds 10 square feet
    
-   Caused by contaminated water
    
-   Porous surfaces, air ducts, HVAC systems involved

If the issue exceeds 10 square feet, was caused by contaminated water, is found in your air ducts or HVAC system, or causes respiratory issues, professional remediation is recommended. The cost of professional mold remediation typically varies between $1,100 and $3,400 depending on factors such as home size, type and scope of mold, and location of the mold issue. 

### 💰Here’s what you can expect to pay based on where the mold is in your home:


| Location    | Average Cost |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Bathroom    | $500-$1,333   |
| Crawl Space | $500-$1,833   |
| Basement    | $833-$3,167   |
| Attic       | $1,000-$4,833  |


## How do I hire a professional?

### If you’ve had the misfortune of finding a smelly friend in your new home, here’s what to do next if you need to hire a professional to evict your moisture-mesmerized tenant.

1.  Research and choose a reputable mold remediation service in your area. Look for companies that are licensed, insured, and have good reviews from previous customers.
    
2.  Ask for a written estimate that outlines the scope of the work and the cost. The estimate should include a detailed description of the work to be done, the materials to be used, and the timeline for completion.
    
3.  Make sure the remediation service follows industry best practices for mold removal, such as protective gear, sealing off affected areas, and properly disposing of contaminated materials.
    
4.  Once the remediation is complete, the service should provide a certificate of mold remediation, which certifies that the mold has been removed and the area is safe for occupancy.
    
5.  Take steps to prevent mold from returning by fixing the underlying issue that caused the mold in the first place by repairing leaks or improving ventilation.

Mold can be a serious issue that affects both the structure of your home and your health. It’s the roommate that no one wants, and it certainly has a penchant for sticking around. Fortunately, a quick inspection can save you time, headache, and heartache before buying a new home. Don’t stay complacent; make mold mad.
