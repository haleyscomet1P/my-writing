# Article: The ultimate guide to mold inspections

### What is a mold inspection?

  

A mold inspection is a vital part of the home buying process. Itâ€™s a specialized type of home inspection, separate from a general home inspection, specifically aimed at identifying the presence and scope of mold issues in a house. On average it costs about $641. Mold inspections arenâ€™t very common, but may be advisable if youâ€™re buying a home with a suspected mold issue. Sometimes homeowners will get a mold inspection as well, if they suspect a mold issue is present.

Read on to learn everything you need to know about mold inspections, including when you might need one, how they work, costs, and what happens if you find mold.

## Why would I need a mold inspection?Â 

If youâ€™re purchasing a home and your general home inspector sees evidence of or suspects a major mold issue, they may recommend getting a specialized mold inspection. This can help you avoid potential costly repairs to remediate the mold and the underlying issue causing it after closing. Additionally, if you own a home and suspect a major mold issue or have family members experiencing unexplained respiratory issues, a mold inspection may be warranted.Â 

The presence of mold in a home isnâ€™t always an immediate cause for panic. Minor mold issues can sometimes be easy to deal with. But major infestations can be a major issue and expensive to fix, especially when theyâ€™re behind walls, floors, or in an HVAC system.Â 

In addition to its unsightly appearance and bad smell, the structures of the house can be damaged by mold including subflooring, insulation, and drywall. Mold can also cause health issues for those living in its midst, such as respiratory issues and other allergic reactions.

Mold is usually a symptom of a bigger problem in your home thatâ€™s creating excess moisture in the home. Common causes include basement flooding, leaky pipes, rotted siding, failed window seals, and inadequate ventilation. Sometimes minor issues can be dealt with by yourself. But if you find a major issue, youâ€™ll usually have to pay for both the mold remediation and to fix the underlying issue causing it.

### What happens during a mold inspection?

During a mold inspection, the inspector will survey the property, paying particular attention to places that are especially prone to mold. These places might include:

  

-   window sills
    
-   behind large appliances

- air ducts
    
-   Plumbing fixtures
    

  

Sometimes, a mold inspector may need to perform invasive procedures like removing a small piece of drywall to access and examine difficult-to-reach spots.Â 

The mold inspector will prepare a report following their inspection. The report will include the results of any laboratory testing to confirm mold types, which will inform the best approach for remediation.Â 

## Mold inspection costs

Â The price of a mold inspection is determined by a number of elements, including the size of your home; the type of specialized mold tests required; the class of mold involved; how easily the inspector can access the affected areas within your home; and other factors unique to your local market. The cost of a mold inspection ranges from between $150 to $2,600, with a $649 national average in the United States.

There are two main methods mold inspectors use to gather mold specimens for testing: air sampling and surface sampling.

Surface sampling is the most common method for testing indoor mold. Itâ€™s also the simplest to perform. This approach costs about $50 per specimen. The inspector will use tape, swabs, or vacuums to collect samples from surfaces in the home, then send them to the lab for analysis.

Air sampling is less common than surface sampling. Itâ€™s typically only conducted if a major mold issue is suspected. Itâ€™s also more expensive, typically costing about $150 per test. This is because the test is more complex to run and analyze. The inspector compares readings from inside and outside the house to see if thereâ€™s a higher concentration of spores indoors.Â 

## My house has mold. Now what?Â 

If a mold inspection uncovers a mold issue in a home, two primary options are available to you: if itâ€™s a minor issue, you can attempt to address it yourself. If itâ€™s a major issue, you may need to hire a professional mold remediation service to handle it.

According to the EPA, if the issue is less than 10 square feet, you can probably safely handle the cleanup yourself. If itâ€™s a hard surface, the fix is often as simple as a scrub with water and detergent. If the surface is absorbent or porous, like a carpet, youâ€™ll likely need to remove and dispose of it.Â 

The EPA says if the issue is larger than 10 square feet, was caused by contaminated water, is in your air ducts or HVAC system,Â  or you have respiratory issues, professional remediation is recommended. Professional mold remediation typically costs between $1,100 and $3,400. It varies based on factors like home size, type and scope of mold, and the location of the mold issue.Â 

Hereâ€™s what you can expect based on where the mold is in your home:

$500 to $1,333
