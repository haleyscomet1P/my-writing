## Our Water Heater Repair Services

Our team of licensed and trained technicians are experts in diagnosing and repairing all types of water heater issues, including:

-   Heating element replacement: If your water heater is not producing hot water, replacing the heating element can solve the issue quickly and cost-effectively.
    
-   Valve repairs: Water heaters have a safety valve that prevents excess pressure from building up in the tank. If the valve is stuck or damaged, it can create a dangerous situation or a damaging leak.
    
-   Burner replacement: Gas-fueled water heaters use burners and pilot lights to heat water. Over time, these components can become corroded, leading to gas leaks and water temperature inconsistencies.
    
-   System replacement: While we always aim to repair your existing water heater, sometimes it may not be the best option. If your water heater is beyond repair, we offer reliable and efficient water heater replacements that are energy-efficient and budget-friendly.

## Signs You Need Water Heater Repair

It's important to recognize the signs of a water heater issue early on to avoid costly repairs or replacements. Some common signs include:

-   Fluctuating water temperatures: Mineral buildup around the water heater's internal parts can cause rising and falling water temperatures.
    
-   Low water pressure: Mineral buildup can also lower hot water pressure by blocking pipes, which can be resolved with water heater repair.
    
-   Leaks: While leaks are an obvious sign of a problem, they can start small and go unnoticed until they cause widespread damage. Regular water heater inspections and repairs can help prevent this.
    
-   Cloudy or foul-smelling water: Mineral deposits within the system can cause tap water to look and smell off.
    
-   Strange noises: Loud popping, banging, and rumbling noises are a cause for concern and can be resolved with water heater repair.
    
-   Rust in the water: Rusty or brown water coming from the building's hot water taps may be caused by a damaged sacrificial anode in the water heater tank.
    
-   Lukewarmness: Several factors can cause lukewarm water, including thermostat settings and usage patterns. However, if these factors are not the issue, it's time to call for water heater repair.
    
-   Hot water runs out early: A system malfunction, such as a faulty burner or heating element, can cause a shortage of hot water.
