The youth of Boston finally have something amazing to write about for what they did over the summer. In a youth-led project sponsored by The City of Boston and Pokémon GO, students were tasked with advocating for a location of historical importance in Boston. What began as a fun way to spend the summer might end with a new way to think about the spaces we live in.

During Participatory Pokémon GO, students were asked to defend a candidate PokéStop in a 60 second video, with emphasis on its historical importance, creativity, and accessibility among other criteria. Winning PokéStops will be permanently added to the game, giving the young people of Boston a chance to truly shape the landscape of their city.

In a generation defined by digital connectedness, students of school age often look past the monuments and landmarks that ultimately mold the communities they live in. By sponsoring Participatory Pokémon GO, we’ve given these students a chance to be the defining factor in the creation of Smart cities centered around the people who reside there. Student selected PokéStops will become the center of a healthy digital infrastructure which will allow Boston and other cities greater livability, workability, and access to city services.	

Pokémon GO was created to bring people of all walks of life together in mutual celebration of their communities as a whole. By giving young people the power to advocate for their own communities, we are eliminating isolation and bringing together areas that might otherwise be estranged. Participatory Pokémon GO is an example of the power of civic engagement, especially when centered around young students. After spending a summer engaged in what makes their community great, it’s hard to imagine these students doing anything less than making Boston an incredible place to live.

We hope you’re having fun playing Pokémon GO! Here’s your second set of Player Tips. Don’t forget to check your inbox for another set next week.

### Level up and earn medals.

Catch wild Pokémon to earn Experience Points (XP) and increase your Trainer level. The higher your level is, the more powerful Pokémon you’ll be able to catch. Once you reach level 5, you’ll even be able to battle with your Pokémon at Gyms and participate in Raid Battles with other Trainers.

You can earn medals by reaching milestones for distance walked, PokéStops visited, Pokémon caught, and other gameplay achievements. Each medal has three achievement tiers: bronze, silver, and gold. Some achievement tiers unlock rewards-- such as an increased chance of successfully catching certain Pokémon types.

That’s all for now, trainer! Be on the lookout for one more email with helpful tips from us next week. Remember to stay alert at all times and be respectful of both your surroundings and others when playing Pokémon GO. Safety first!
